Sensitivity scenarios and data visualizations further enhance its application for strategic decision-making.
The data used for this analysis is collected from HCL Technologies’ official Annual Reports for FY 2022–23 and FY 2023–24. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess real-world disruptions like delayed payments or increased costs. Visual tools—graphs, charts, and summary tables—were employed for clarity. Overall, the cash budget provides HCL with a proactive framework for working capital management, liquidity optimization, and strategic growth.
